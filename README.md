# Luvoratorrry!
This is a laboratory containing various software examples, projects, forays into new/unexplored programming languages, and other types of digital tomfoolery. This was named after the iconic Vocaloid song by **GUMI (グミ)** and **Kagamine Rin (鏡音リン)** called [LUVORATORRRRRY!](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/LUVORATORRRRRY!)


## What's inside . . . so far

### Angular
Stuff made in Angular 2, 4, 4<sup>2</sup> or whatever comes after. Actually, no, it's just called "Angular," and it has one of the most confusing naming schemes I've ever seen in a programming language. They should have at least named it like how Coca-Cola did and went with "Angular Classic" and "NEW Angular" or something. Or maybe Angular 2: Electric Boogaloo.

### React
Things built on the React JavaScript library. Nothing mind-blowing here, just slight deviations from the generic `create-react-app` boilerplate.
